Mixin Bot is an awesome design to extend flexible features in Mixin Messenger. A typical use case is building [super group](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/supergroup.mixin.one). 

But for common users, it's difficult to use even with the open source code if you are not famliliar with development skills. Because you have to host it in a service after all.

That's why [OhMy.Xin](https://ohmy.xin) exists.

[OhMy.Xin](https://ohmy.xin) will host your Mixin Bot for you to build an awesome community app.
